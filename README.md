Project Description
The system is designed around two main users:

Admin Side
Events like hackathons, seminars, workshops, and cultural festivals can be created and managed by staff or faculty members.  
Monitoring student registrations, marking attendance , and viewing reports .  

 Student Side

2. Students register for chosen events.  
3. On the event day, attendance is marked in the system.  
4. Students rate their experience after the event.  
5. The system generates reports such as:
    Total registrations per event  
    Attendance percentage  
    Average feedback score  
    Event popularity ranking

    Top 3 most active students  

 Uses of the Project
Efficient Event Management: Eliminates the traditional methods manual work by simplifying the entire process.
Easy Student Participation: Students can quickly register, check in, and give feedback without hassle.

Colleges often organize a number of events every semester/year, but tracking a huge crowd of participation ,collecting feedback  manually is very  time-consuming and can also lead many human-made errors.  
This system solves that problem by:
   Automating registrations and attendance.  
   Storing all data securely in a database.  
   Generating reports in seconds instead of hours.  
Allowing a smooth experience for both staff, students and management. 
The result is a smooth event experience for both administrators and students, while also giving the management valuable insights about engagement and popularity.

Additional Features that can be improvised:
  QR code check-ins, certificates for participants, and push notifications for upcoming events.
